## Premise
Diveboard is a solution to the problem of recruitment in the dive industry.  The currently dominant job sites for divers have few features and poor UX, Diveboard offers instructors and dive centers a better altnernative by enabling them to limit their job searches/applicants to only those that are suitable for them.

## Brief

My approach to working on Diveboard was highly structured.  Initially I commited significant time to developing a comprehensive Trello board and wireframes that provided clear objectives and direction for the project.

Working on the back end I practiced TDD, producing a suite of 61 API tests using Mocha and Chai.  Once the full API was built and all tests were passing then I moved on to the React app.

On the front end I built out the structure and styling simultaneously
